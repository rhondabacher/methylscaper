\title{Calculates the percentage of methylated cells/molecules per site}
\usage{
methyl_percent_site(orderObject, makePlot = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{orderObject}{An object of class \code{orderObject}}

\item{makePlot}{Logical, indicates whether to generate the percentage plot}

\item{...}{Additional parameters used by the \code{plot} function.}
}
\value{
The percent of reads or cells methylated (endogenous (yellow) 
     or accessible) at each site. Output is a list with names "red" 
     and "yellow". Red represents the endogenous methylation and 
     yellow represents the accessibility. Within each list object is a 
     vector of the percent of cells/molecules methylated. The location 
     of the site is also represent in the form CXX, where XX is the 
     position of the site within the defined region.
