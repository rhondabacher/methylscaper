\title{Calculate the average methylation/accessibility status across all reads.}
\usage{
methyl_average_status(orderObject, window_length = 20, makePlot = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{orderObject}{An object of class \code{orderObject}}

\item{window_length}{Length of the window to be used to compute a 
moving average. Default is 20.}

\item{makePlot}{Logical, indicates whether to generate a line plot of 
average status.}

\item{...}{Addition parameters used by the \code{plot} function.}
}
\value{
The proportion of methylated bases for each cell/molecule 
     within a defined moving window. Output is a list with elements 
     "meth_avg" and "acc_avg", indicating endogenous
     or accessible methylation respectively.
}
\description{
Calculate the average methylation/accessibility status across all reads.
}
\examples{
 
data(day7)

orderObj <- initialOrder(day7$gch, day7$hcg, Method = "PCA")
average_status(orderObj, plotAverages = TRUE)

}
