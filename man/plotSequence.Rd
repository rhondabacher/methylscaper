\usage{
plotSequence(
  orderObject,
  plotFAST = TRUE,
  blankWidth = 75,
  Title = "",
  drawLine = TRUE,
  drawKey = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{orderObject}{An object of class \code{orderObject} that contains 
the processed data and the ordering.}

\item{plotFAST}{Logical, setting to FALSE will generate a higher 
quality plot. TRUE generates a lower resolution file, useful to improve
speed while testing. For publication quality use plotFAST=TRUE.}

\item{blankWidth}{Indicates the amount of space to leave between
the two plots}

\item{Title}{The title of the plot.}

\item{drawLine}{Logical, indicates whether to draw a line above 
the CG/GC sites.}

\item{drawKey}{Logical, indicates whether to draw a key representing
a 147bp nucleosome at the bottom of the plot.}
}
\value{
Output is two side-by-side heatmaps with the endogenous 
   methylation (HCG) on the left and the acciessibility methylation (GCH)
   on the right. The tick marks at the top indicate
   either HCG or GCH sites when drawLine=TRUE. If drawKey=TRUE then a black
   rectangle key is plot at the bottom of the heatmap that is 147 basepairs
   long. In the HCG plot, red patches represent methylation between two 
   sites; black patches represent unmethylated bases between two
   unmethylated sites; and gray patches are base pairs which have one
   methylated site and one unmethylated site flanking. In the HCG plot,
   yellow patches represent accessibility between two sites; black patches
   represent occupied bases  between two occupied sites; and gray patches
   are base pairs which have one methylated site and one 
   unmethylated site flanking.
