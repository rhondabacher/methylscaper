\title{Process single-cell data}
\usage{
prepSC(
  gc_seq_data,
  cg_seq_data,
  startPos = NULL,
  endPos = NULL,
  updateProgress = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gc_seq_data}{GC accessibility data, in the form of a list of 
dataframes.}

\item{cg_seq_data}{CG methylation data, in the form of a list of 
dataframes.}

\item{startPos}{The index of the first position to include 
in the visualization. If using this within the R console it is 
recomended to specify the start and end directly.
In the Shiny app, a slider will let the user refine these positions.}

\item{endPos}{The index of the final position to include in the visualization.}

\item{updateProgress}{A function for generating progress bars in the Shiny app. 
Should be left NULL otherwise.}
}
\value{
The output is a list containing the elements 'gch' and 'hcg. 
     Each is a dataframe with reads/cells on the rows and each column 
     is a base-pair. The matrix is coded as follows:
         -2: unmethylated GCH or HCG site
         -1: base pairs between two unmethylated GCH or HCG sites
         0: base pairs between mismatching methylation states of 
             two GCH or HCG sites
         1: base pairs between two methylated GCH or HCG sites
         2: methylated GCH or HCG site
}
\description{
This function generates representation methylation-state matrices from 
 single-cell methylation data (for example, as generated by the Bismarck 
 software program). See the vignette for a more thorough explanation 
 of each parameter.
