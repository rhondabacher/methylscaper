\usage{
initialOrder(
  dataIn,
  Method = "PCA",
  weightStart = NULL,
  weightEnd = NULL,
  weightFeature = "red",
  updateProgress = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataIn}{A list object containing two elements labelled gch and hcg (already pre-processed.)}

\item{Method}{Indicates the seriation method to use. The default option
is "PCA", which orders the data using a weighted first principal component approach. Any 
seriation method provided in the \code{seriation} package is also valid input.}

\item{weightStart}{Index of the first column used in the weighted seriation.}

\item{weightEnd}{Index of the last column used in the weighted seriation.}

\item{weightFeature}{Indicates whether to weight the GCH or HCG data.
Valid input to weight the GCH is 'gch', 'acc', or 'yellow'. To weight the HCG, 
valid input for this option is 'hcg', 'met', or 'red'.}

\item{updateProgress}{A function to handle the progress bar for the 
Shiny app. Should not be used when using the function independently.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{orderObject}, which contains the generated
 ordering ($order1) and a clean data matrix ($toClust) 
 to be passed into the plotting function plotSequence().
}
\description{
This function performs the weighted seriation procedure
described in the methylscaper manuscript if the method is set to "PCA".
The data may also be ordered using a given seriation method from the
seriation R package. The weighting is done between a designated start and end
base pair chosen by the user, and the weight can be done on the 
endogenous methylation or the accessibility.
