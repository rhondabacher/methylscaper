\title{Calculate the proportion of methylated bases for each cell/molecule}
\usage{
methyl_proportion_cell(orderObject, color = "YELLOW", makePlot = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{orderObject}{An object of class \code{orderObject}}

\item{color}{Indicates which data set to compute proportions for.
This should be RED for endogenous methylation or YELLOW for
accessibility.}

\item{makePlot}{Indicates whether to plot a histogram of the proportions 
across all reads.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters used by the \code{hist} function.}
}
\value{
The proportion of methylated (endogenous (yellow) 
     or accessible) bases for each cell/molecule. Output is vector
     with length the numbner of cells/molecules and contains a proportion.
}
