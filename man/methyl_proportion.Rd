\title{Calculate the proportion of methylated bases for each cell/molecule}
\usage{
methyl_proportion(
  orderObject,
  type = "yellow",
  over = "bases",
  makePlot = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{orderObject}{An object of class \code{orderObject}}

\item{type}{Indicates which data set to compute proportions for.
This should be 'met' or 'hcg' or 'red' for endogenous methylation; 'acc' or
'gch' or 'yellow' for accessibility.}

\item{over}{Indicates whether to calculate the proportion of methylated bases or sites.
The bases option will calculate all of the 'inferred' methylation between sites,
whereas the site option will only calculate at the HCG or GCH sites.}

\item{makePlot}{Indicates whether to plot a histogram of the proportions 
across all cells/molcules.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters used by the \code{hist} function.}
}
\value{
The proportion of methylated (endogenous (yellow) 
     or accessible) bases for each cell/molecule. Output is vector
     with length the numbner of cells/molecules and contains a proportion.

\description{
Calculate the proportion of methylated bases for each cell/molecule
