# methylscaper

`methylscaper` is an R package that provides functions for processing and
visualizing data generated by methods jointly profiling methylation and chromatin accessibility (MAPit, NOMe-seq, scNMT-seq, nanoNOMe, etc.). The package offers processing for
both single-cell and single-molecule data, and a common interface for jointly visualizing both data types through the generation of ordered representational methylation-state matrices. The package provides a Shiny app to allow for interactive seriation process of refinement and re-weighting that optimally orders the single DNA molecules to discover methylation patterns and nucleosome positioning.

# Webserver

`methylscaper` is available for use on a webserver located at [www.methylscaper.com](http://www.methylscaper.com) and clicking on "Start Shiny App". Also located on the website is easy access to the vignette and example datasets to use.

# Installation

For local use of methylscaper, it can be installed into R by:

```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly=TRUE))
    install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rhondabacher/methylscaper", build_vignettes=TRUE)
```
Note: on Ubuntu, users may need to install libgsl via:
`sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev`

For any other installation issues/questions please leave a message on our [Github Issues]((https://github.com/rhondabacher/methylscaper/issues))

Then load the package into R:

```{r}
library(methylscaper)
```

To use methylscaper as a shiny app, just type:
```{r}
methylscaper::methylscaper()
```

Many more details on how to use the shiny app or functions directly in R are located in the vignette:
```{r}
browseVignettes('methylscaper')
```


A preprint of the methylscaper manuscript is now available on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.13.382465v1).
