Title: Visualization of Methylation Data
Description: methylscaper is an R package for processing and visualizing data jointly
  profiling methylation and chromatin accessibility (MAPit, NOMe-seq, scNMT-seq, nanoNOMe,
  etc.). The package supports both single-cell and single-molecule data, and 
  a common interface for jointly visualizing both data types through the generation of
  ordered representational methylation-state matrices. The Shiny app allows for an 
  interactive seriation process of refinement and re-weighting that optimally 
  orders the cells or DNA molecules to discover methylation patterns and nucleosome 
  positioning.
